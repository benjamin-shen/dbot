# dbot
Written by Benjamin Shen

## Functionality
All possible commands can be found in [commands.txt](dictionaries/commands.txt).  
All recognized keywords can be found in [keywords.txt](dictionaries/keywords.txt).  

Future ideas for the bot can be found in [todo.txt](developer/todo.txt).  

### Bugs
There is an occasional delay in the bot's response.  
The GroupMe on PC sometimes displays messages in the wrong order.  

### Warnings
If you are modifying the code, keep in mind that  
- I use `eval()` in [dbot.py](dbot.py).  
- some keywords/responses are inappropriate for the general public. Please keep in mind your target group.
